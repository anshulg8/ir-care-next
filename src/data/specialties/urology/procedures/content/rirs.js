But it is not 'one size fits all.' The most important determinants are: stone size and burden, stone location inside the kidney, anatomy and access, infection/obstruction risk, and your medical profile."

There is recurrent pain, repeated ER visits, or persistent stone presence with symptoms. You have a stone pattern where RIRS offers a good balance of safety and effectiveness.\n\nRIRS is often chosen because it avoids a direct puncture into the kidney (as in PCNL) while still allowing active stone treatment."
