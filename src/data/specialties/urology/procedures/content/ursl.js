This is often after: repeated pain episodes, persistent obstruction on imaging, lack of progress over time, job/travel constraints where waiting is not reasonable, or infection risk (in which case timing becomes urgent).\n\nURSL is a standard, widely performed procedure. The most important thing is ensuring: the stone truly requires intervention, the infection/obstruction risks are handled properly, and you understand what to expect, including stent-related symptoms."
