But when stone burden is larger or the pattern is complex, the most protective approach is often one that can clear the stones reliably in a single planned session.\n\nMini-PCNL (mini percutaneous nephrolithotomy) is designed for that scenario: it uses a small tract directly into the kidney, allows efficient stone removal, and is commonly chosen when the goal is definitive clearance with high probability.\n\nIt is still minimally invasive\u2014but it is more involved than URSL/RIRS. The advantage is effectiveness for appropriate stone patterns."
