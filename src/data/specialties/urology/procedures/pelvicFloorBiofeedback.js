Pelvic floor biofeedback is designed to solve exactly that: it helps you identify the correct muscles, coordinate them properly, and build a measurable training program that improves control.\n\nThis is not a \"quick fix.\" It is a structured rehabilitation approach that can meaningfully improve quality of life\u2014often without medications or surgery."
