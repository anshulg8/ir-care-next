If you're reading this during an episode, the first priority is safety: controlling pain, preventing dehydration, and making sure there isn't an infection or dangerous obstruction.\n\nMany cases are due to kidney stones. But the right response depends on your symptoms, your temperature, and what imaging shows.\n\nYou do not need to panic. You do need a structured approach like what India's top urologists follow at MyDocsy."
