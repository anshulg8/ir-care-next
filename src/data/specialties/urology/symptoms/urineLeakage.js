Many people quietly reduce travel, stop workouts, avoid intimacy, or carry pads everywhere. Some assume it's \"normal after childbirth,\" \"normal with age,\" or \"the price of prostate surgery.\"\n\nIt is common. But it is not something you should simply accept. In many patients, the right plan brings meaningful improvement—sometimes complete resolution.\n\nThe safest first step is to identify which type of leakage you have, rule out a few important conditions, and then choose a structured treatment pathway."
