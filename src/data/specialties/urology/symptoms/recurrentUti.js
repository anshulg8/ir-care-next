Many patients—especially women—go through repeated cycles: symptoms → antibiotics → temporary relief → recurrence.\n\nA careful urology approach is different. It asks: Is this truly infection each time (confirmed on culture)? If it is infection, what is driving recurrence? If it is not infection, what else is causing the same symptoms?\n\nThe goal is not to keep chasing episodes. The goal is to break the pattern safely."
