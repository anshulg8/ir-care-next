Many people quietly adjust their life around it: planning routes by bathrooms, avoiding travel, waking up exhausted, or feeling embarrassed in public.\n\nMost of the time, the cause is treatable. The key is not to guess. The key is to identify the pattern, rule out a few important risks, and then choose a step-by-step plan."
