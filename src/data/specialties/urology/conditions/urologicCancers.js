Many people delay evaluation because the bleeding stops. That delay can cost time.\n\nThis page is not meant to alarm you. It is meant to guide you clearly: what symptoms matter, what tests are typically required, what procedures like cystoscopy and TURBT actually are, how staging and risk influence follow-up, and what next steps to take.\n\nThe guiding principle is simple: evaluate early, treat appropriately, follow up reliably."
