But kidney lesions fall into different categories: simple cysts (often benign), complex cysts that need monitoring or evaluation, solid masses that require structured assessment, localized kidney cancers that are often curable.\n\nA protective plan answers three questions:\n1. What exactly is this lesion (cyst vs solid, benign vs suspicious)?\n2. Is it localized and treatable (in most cases, yes)?\n3. What option best preserves kidney function while treating the disease safely?"
