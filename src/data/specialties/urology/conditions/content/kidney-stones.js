The bigger problem is when stones cause obstruction with infection, repeated ER visits, or recurrence without a prevention plan.\n\nA protective approach has two phases:\n1. Acute phase: ensure safety (pain control, rule out infection/obstruction risk).\n2. Definitive phase: choose the least invasive effective treatment for the stone pattern, and then build prevention based on stone type.\n\nYou should never feel rushed into a procedure, but you also should not be left in repeated cycles of pain without a plan."
