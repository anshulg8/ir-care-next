For many men it causes mild symptoms that remain stable for years. For others, it gradually affects sleep, travel, work, and quality of life. In some cases, it can lead to urinary retention, infections, or strain on the bladder and kidneys.\n\nA good BPH plan is not \"medicines forever\" or \"surgery quickly.\"\nA good BPH plan is: 1) understand how much obstruction exists, 2) check whether the bladder/kidneys are being affected, and 3) choose a treatment that matches your anatomy, health profile, and priorities."
