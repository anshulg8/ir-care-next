You care about the impact: interrupted sleep, anxiety during travel or meetings, embarrassment or loss of confidence, constant planning around toilets, fear that this will get worse.\n\nMost importantly: these symptoms are treatable, and the right plan often starts with understanding your pattern, not jumping to a procedure."
